            <div class="card-content">
                <h4 class="text-left">Apple</h4>
                <p class="text-left"><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">apple.com</a></p>
                <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Apple home page">
                <p class="text-left">The principle of white space and clean design is widely used by Apple developers, basically, this principle is used to highlight certain features on a web page, like a title, a paragraph, a button, or an image, and also to locate the content in a group so that the user understands that it is related. In the case of the image, this principle is used to highlight a customer card that Apple offers. Here can be seen how some space is left on the sides and in each title, paragraph, and link to form a group of elements that highlight the card.</p>

                <h4 class="text-left">National Geographic</h4>
                <p class="text-left"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/" target="_blank">nationalgeographic.com</a></p>
                <img src="images/natgeo.jpg" alt="NatGeo home page">
                <p class="text-left">As its name indicates, this principle is based on using similar or identical elements throughout a web page, the main objective is to maintain the consistency that exists on the page, which is why this principle is one of the most important in web design. This image shows two cards that link to articles on the page, this type of card is something that is used on multiple occasions throughout the entire page, and they always follow the same pattern, they have an image at the top, a title, and under the title a paragraph that invites the user to know more about the topic to which the card refers.</p>

        <section class="card">
            <h3 class="text-left">PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <div class="card-content">
                <h4 class="text-left">SQUARESPACE</h4>
                <p class="text-left"><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">squarespace.com</a></p>
                <img src="images/squarespace.jpg" alt="Squarespace home page">
                <p class="text-left">The contrast principle is widely used to capture the user's attention when viewing the content and indicate the key elements of the web page. In the image, it can be seen how this page is split into some sections and each section has different information, therefore thanks to the contrast of the colors used someone can clearly distinguish the difference that exists between each section and even the objective that each one has.</p>
